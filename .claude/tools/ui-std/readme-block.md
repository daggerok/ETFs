### Column types and filters

Every column of the ETF catalog and of the Watchlist, Holdings, History and Distributions tabs has a type: text (`ABC`), number (`123`), percentage (`%`), money (`$`), date (`D`), date and time (`DT`) or time of day (`T`). The type is detected from the texts the column shows (80% of the filled cells must agree, otherwise text) and is written in the badge next to the column title: click it to cycle the type, Shift+click to return to auto-detection. Dates are read as `2024-06-15`, `6/15/2024`, `15.06.2024`, `Jun 15, 2024` or `15-Jun-2024`, date and time as `2024-06-15T09:30:00Z` or `2024-06-15 09:30`, time as `09:30`, `16:00:00` or `9:30 PM`

A row of filter inputs sits under the column headers (the `Filters` button hides it, `Clear filters` empties it). Filters of different columns are combined with AND, the search box applies on top, and Copy Tickers and the exports use the filtered rows. Filters and type overrides are remembered in the browser

Inside one filter: a space means AND, a comma means OR, a leading `!` means NOT, `?` matches an empty or unavailable value and `!?` a value that is there; a value that is unavailable matches only `?` and negated conditions. An unquoted space ends the value, so quote values that contain one (`>="2024-06-15 09:30"`)

| Type | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Text | `bank` contains, `"two words"`, `!bank`, `=exact`, `^starts`, `ends$`, `/regex/`, `tech, health` |
| Number, percentage, money | `>10`, `>=10 <50`, `=22` (matches what rounds to 22), `!=22`, `10..50`, `..50`, `10..`, `>1B` and `K` `M` `B` `T` suffixes, an optional `$` or `%` |
| Date, date and time | `>2024-06-01`, `2024` (the whole year), `2024-06` (the whole month), `2024-01..2024-06`, `today`, `yesterday`, `-7d..` (the last 7 days), `+2w`, `-3m`, `-1y` |
| Time | `>09:30`, `09:30..16:00`, `=12:00` (the whole minute) |
